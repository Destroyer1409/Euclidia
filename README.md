I (Yasx pronounced "Yasix") am developping a bunch of libraries for mathemacical operations on prime numbers.

For the time being this draft (when compiled) asks for a number (an long signed integer, so it cannot exceed 2'147'483'647) and gives you the dividers of this number and the prime factors with their respective exponent.
E.g. 4213 returns 11 and 383 for both dividers and prime factors.

Thanks to AeroStun whom helps me to optimize code.
