I (Yasx pronounced "Yasix") is developping a bunch of libraries for mathemacical operations on prime numbers.

For the time being this draft (when compiled) ask for a number (integer so not exceed 2'147'483'647) and give you the dividers of this number and the prime factors with their respective exponent.
E.g. 4213 return 11 and 383 for both dividers and prime factors.

Thanks to AeroStun whom helps me to optimise code.
